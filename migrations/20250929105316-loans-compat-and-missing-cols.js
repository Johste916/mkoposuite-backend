/**
 * Safe, idempotent compat migration for `loans`:
 * - Adds commonly referenced columns IF NOT EXISTS (no-op if present).
 * - Creates a read-only view `v_loans_compat` exposing both snake_case and camelCase
 *   aliases, useful for debugging/analytics and guarding against stray SELECTs.
 *
 * This does NOT drop any columns, and does NOT change existing data.
